# Crazy Johan ü§™

**The only file shredder that works with the destructive passion of a truly legendary manager.**

Meet `Crazy Johan`, a digital tribute to a man, a myth, a legend of corporate destruction. This tool ensures that your files are not just deleted, but are sent to the digital afterlife with extreme prejudice.

-----

## A Tribute to Chaos

We all once knew a manager like Johan. A man with a reverse Midas touch. Everything he touched turned to... well, let's just say it required an IT ticket. He could crash a server by just looking at it, corrupt a database by asking about its performance, and delete a critical folder while trying to change his desktop background.

This tool channels that same chaotic energy to **permanently and irrecoverably delete your files**. It's not just deletion; it's a statement.

## Features

* **Ferocious Overwriting**: Viciously scribbles random data over your files multiple times, making them as unrecoverable as Johan's last quarterly report.
* **The `-mumbling` Protocol**: For when you need to be *absolutely sure*. This mode not only shreds the file but also fills all free space on your disk to wipe any lingering data ghosts. Johan called this "reorganizing the shared drive."
* **Cross-Platform Chaos**: Works on Windows and Linux, because digital destruction knows no OS boundaries.
* **Written in Go**: So it performs its destructive duties with terrifying speed.

## Installation

Getting your hands on this weapon of mass deletion is easy. No need to build from source (unless you want to).

1.  Head over to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Mastemmah/CrazyJohan/releases)**.
2.  Download the latest archive for your operating system:
    * For **Windows**, grab the `.zip` file.
    * For **Linux** or **macOS**, grab the `.tar.gz` file.
3.  Unpack the archive, and you're ready to unleash the Johan.

## How to Use

Using Crazy Johan is as simple as pointing him at something and watching the ensuing carnage. Open your terminal or command prompt and let him loose.

**Standard Destruction (For everyday messes)**

This will overwrite and delete a single file.

```bash
# Point Johan at his target
./crazy_johan /path/to/your/unwanted-file.txt

# And... it's gone. Poof.
```

**Mumbling Mode (For when there can be no witnesses)**

This will shred the file AND activate the disk-wiping protocol to eliminate any trace evidence. You will be warned before it begins.

```bash
# Tell Johan to start mumbling...
./crazy_johan -mumbling /path/to/that/very-secret-file.docx
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE BIG FAT WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is not a joke. Well, the story is, but the software isn't.

**üî• THIS TOOL PERMANENTLY DESTROYS DATA. üî•**

There is no "undo". There is no "undelete". There is no "Recycle Bin". There is no "oopsie-daisy" button.

The data will be more gone than Johan's coffee mug after the office cleaning crew visited. Use it on files you **never, ever** want to see again. We are not responsible if you delete your family photos, your tax returns, or the secret formula for Coca-Cola.

## Building From Source
